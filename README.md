# Undocked Windows Development

The goal of this project is to provide helpers for Windows components to build exactly as they would internally in the Windows OS repository, but without a lot of complicated manual steps.

This project provides three main components:

- [windows.undocked.props](vs/windows.undocked.props) - Visual Studio property file to simplify components' project files.
- [windows.undocked.targets](vs/windows.undocked.targets) - Similar to the .props file, but only required if source link is being used.
- [build.yml](onebranch/v1/build.yml) - Azure Pipelines template to correctly build in OneBranch (Microsoft's **internal** Azure Pipelines sandbox).

## Usage

To use this project in your component, you must:

#### Get Local Build Working

1. Submodule this repository into your component's repository.
1. Create a `version.json` file to hold your component's version (see [example](templates/version.json)).
1. Update your component's project files to set the undocked variables (see [examples](templates)).
1. Import [windows.undocked.props](vs/windows.undocked.props).

#### Get OneBranch Build Working

1. Copy the `.azure` directory into your project.
1. Update the `OneBranch.*.yml` files as necessary for your project.
1. Onboard these new pipelines to OneBranch.
   - Requires a [service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#azure-repos) to GitHub (name it `Undocked GitHub`).

> **Note** - As mentioned above, OneBranch is an internal to Microsoft build environment. If you are not a Microsoft employee, you will not be able to use these pipelines. You can, however, still leverage the property file to build locally.
